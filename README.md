A basic shooting game using OpenGL library in C language. The player can first select which level they wish to play by clicking on the level box. When the game starts, there is an arithmetic question at the bottom of the screen with four options. one of the options is the correct answer. There are two scores, the computer's score and the player's. There is a farmer in the middle of the screen with a rotating barrel instead of a nose. There is also a bird placed randomly anywhere on the screen with a random colour and a random score. When the farmer's barrel aligns with the bird, the farmer will shoot a shuriken at the bird. The higher the level of the game, the fast the farmer's barrel will rotate. The goal is to quickly select the right answer to the arithmetic question at the bottom. If the player selects the right answer, the bird will fly away and the points will be added to the player's total score. If the player selects the wrong answer, or is too late is selecting, the farmer will shoot the bird and the points will be added to the computer's score. The game ends in 60 seconds.
